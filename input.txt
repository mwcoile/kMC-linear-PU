Enter the polymerization temperature (K),500
Would you like to run to a specified conversion rather than a specified reaction time? (Y/N),Y
Enter the desired reaction time in seconds. (This will be ignored if 'Y' is chosen above), 360
Alternatively enter the desired fractional conversion of alcohol you wish to run to (e.g. 0.95). (This will be ignored if 'N' is chosen above), 0.95
Enter the number of monomers you wish to simulate. More monomers will lead to more precise results but require more computational time,100000
Enter mass(es) of diol monomers as a comma separated list (g/mol, 1700, 154.25
Enter initial concentration(s) of the diol monomers as a comma separated list (M), 0.9,0.1
Enter mass(es) of diisocyanate monomers as a comma separated list (g/mol), 250
Enter initial concentration(s) of the diisocyanate monomers as a comma separated list (M), 1
Enter activation energy for each diol/diisocyanate pair in kJ/mol. Order them as follows: diol 1 with diisocyanate 1; diol 1 with diisocyanate 2; etc, 30, 30
Enter Arrhenius preexponential factor (A) for each diol/diisocyanate pair in L/(mol s). Order them as follows: diol 1 with diisocyanate 1; diol 1 with diisocyanate 2; etc, 10000,10000
Enter a description of the simulation to be appended to the output filenames, masterbranch
